Machine Learning enables algorithms to discover patterns within datasets, allowing them to make prediction on new data.

Overview of Machine Learning Lifecycle

1. Data Collection: images, text, numerical data
2. Data pre-processing: cleaning data(), transforming (normilization and scaling), splitting into training and validation
3. Choosing a model: decision trees, neural networks, suport vector machines, and deep learning architectures.
4. Training the model: Model trained using training data, adjusts parameters to reduce predicted outputs versus actual outputs
5. Evaluating the Model: using test data to access performance
6. Fine-tuning: adjusting hyperparamters to improve performance
7. Inference: Applying the learning pattern recogntion to new data

3 Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Trained on labeled dataset, (has the answer sheet, learns from mistakes).
There are two types:
- Regression
- Classification

2. Unsupervised Learning: Tries to understrand the data (without the answer sheet) tries to understand the structure of it all
There are two types:
 - Clustering
 - Dimensionality reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning: where it takes actions, resulting in a reward or a penalty, trying to maximize the reward over time
Two types:
- Model-based reinforced learning
- Model-free reinfored learning
