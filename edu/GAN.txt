Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generative-adversarial-network-gan/

Used for unsupervised learning. GANs are made up of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator.

Adversarial learning:
- generator attempts to fool the Discriminator, which is tasked with accurately distinguishing between generated and real data.
- the better the generator becomes, the better the discriminator needs to become
- the better the discriminator becomes, the better the generator needs to become
- realistic, high quality samples are produced as a result of this competitive interaction
- revolutionized generative modeling

Types of GANs:
- Vanilla GAN: Basic structure; simple and used for general tasks
- Conditional GAN: Adds control by using conditional statements
- Deep Convolutional GAN: Utilizes convolutional layers for more efficient and detailed image generation,
- Laplacian Pyramid GAN: Uses multiple generators and discriminators across different resolution levels to progressively refine and generate high-quality images
- Super Resolution GAN: Specialized for enhancing the resolution of low-quality images, focusing on up-scaling and adding fine details.
